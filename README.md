# Order System - Python

## Description

I wanted to apply the pythonic principles that I had been developing over the course of a week. This type of app is ideal for implementing many of the core python principles.
This app allows the user to select from a predetermined menu of food items. The user also has the ability to choose the number of each item selected. At the end of the user's selection phase, the total amount will be tallied  based on the number of items selected and their cost.
